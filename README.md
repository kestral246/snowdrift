Snowdrift
=========
Extensions to **snowdrift 0.6.3** by **paramat**

For Minetest 5.0.0 and later.

Depends: default

Changes
-------
I've tried to make the abrupt transitions in this mod a little smoother.

- Cloud cover gradually increases before rain starts, and gradually decreases after rain stops.
- Fully overcast skies gradually lighten and darken at dawn and dusk.
- Amount of rain and/or snow falling gradually increases or decreases.
- Crossing into or out of dry desert biomes gradually decreases or increases amount of precipitation.
- Crossing into or out of freezing biomes gradually shifts percentage of rain versus snow.
- Rain sound gradually changes volume based on amount of rain falling.


I've also included debug code, which can be enabled by setting debug = true.
